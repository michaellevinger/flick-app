## 📱 What is flick?

A mobile app that helps people meet at festivals and events. Instead of endless swiping, users scan a QR code at the venue, see who else is there, and "flick" people they want to meet. When two people flick each other - instant Green Light to connect!

### B2B Value Proposition

**For Festival Sponsors:**
- Each festival gets a unique QR code
- Users are locked into isolated rooms per event
- Direct attribution: "This match happened at YOUR festival"
- Sponsor branding on every match: "Coachella 2024 - Sponsored by Heineken"
- Drive booth traffic with number exchange feature

**Pricing Model:** $2,000-$5,000 per festival/weekend
