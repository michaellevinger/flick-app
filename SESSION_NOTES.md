- App is configured and ready to connect once database schema is set up

---

## Current Status: Supabase Database Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Completed Steps:
1. Supabase project created
2. .env file created with credentials
3. PostGIS extension enabled (ran `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;`)
4. **Base schema SQL executed** (users, nudges, functions)
5. **Exchange schema SQL executed** (exchanges table, phone_number column)
6. **Storage bucket created** (selfies, PUBLIC)

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS: End-to-End Testing

#### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
cd /Users/michaellevinger/dev/spot-app/spot-app
npx expo start
```

#### Step 2: Test Full User Journey
1. **Onboarding:**
   - Take a selfie (or choose from gallery)
   - Enter name and age
   - Verify profile saves to Supabase

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Check that status defaults to ON
   - Verify location tracking starts automatically
   - Test ON/OFF toggle

3. **Proximity Testing (requires 2 devices):**
   - Create profiles on 2 devices
   - Move devices within 100m of each other
   - Verify they appear in each other's radar
   - Test distance sorting

4. **Nudge System:**
   - User A nudges User B
   - Verify User B sees green border + "Wants to meet"
   - User B nudges back
   - Verify both see Green Light screen with haptics

5. **Number Exchange:**
   - From Green Light, request number
   - Accept on other device
   - Verify both see each other's numbers
   - Check 15-minute countdown timer
   - Test distance-based wipe (move >100m apart)

#### Step 3: Verify Database
Check Supabase dashboard to confirm:
- Users are being created in `users` table
- Locations are being stored correctly
- Nudges are being recorded in `nudges` table
- Exchanges are created with proper TTL

---

## Important Files & Locations

### Configuration
- `.env` - Supabase credentials (✅ configured, not in git)
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Supabase client (reads from .env)

### Database Schema
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Base schema (users, nudges, functions)
- `supabase-exchanges-schema.sql` - Number exchange schema

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main project documentation (updated with status)
- `NUMBER_EXCHANGE_SETUP.md` - Complete guide for number exchange feature
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step backend setup guide
- `README.md` - Updated with all features including Number Exchange

### Verification
- `verify-supabase.js` - Script to test Supabase connection (needs schema first)

---

## Known Issues to Address

### Issue During Setup:
When running the second SQL query, you got this error:
```
ERROR: 42883: function postgis_version() does not exist
```

**Solution:** This was a test query. The actual fix was running:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

This succeeded. Now just need to run the table creation SQL.

---

## Quick Commands Reference

### Start the app:
```bash
cd /Users/michaellevinger/dev/spot-app/spot-app
npx expo start
```

### Verify Supabase (after schema setup):
```bash
node verify-supabase.js
```

### Git status:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Session 2026-02-03: Storage Setup & Android Bug Fix ✅

### What We Accomplished:

#### 1. Storage Bucket Configuration ✅
- Created "selfies" storage bucket via Supabase Dashboard
- Configured bucket as PUBLIC
- Added RLS policies for uploads, downloads, and deletes:
  - `Allow anonymous uploads` - INSERT policy
  - `Allow public downloads` - SELECT policy
  - `Allow deletes` - DELETE policy
- Verified uploads working with test-upload.js script

#### 2. Fixed Critical Android Bug ✅
**Issue:** `java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean` error
**Root Cause:** Switch component receiving string "true"/"false" instead of boolean
**Solution:**
- Added `normalizeUserData()` helper function to database.js and nudges.js
- Ensures `status` field is always boolean, `age` is always number
- Applied to all database queries: upsertUser(), findNearbyUsers(), getMatchedUserInfo()
- Fixed Switch component in DashboardScreen.js with `Boolean(user.status)`
- Fixed userContext.js to normalize data when loading from AsyncStorage

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure ✅
Created comprehensive testing setup:
- **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete 9-scenario testing guide
- **READY_TO_TEST.md** - Quick start guide with setup instructions
- **manage-storage.js** - Unified storage management script
- **test-upload.js** - Validates storage upload/download/delete
- **test-setup.sh** - One-command verification script
- **check-policies.js** - Debug storage policies

#### 4. Environment Updates ✅
- Updated package.json with dotenv, TypeScript types, Expo CLI
- Updated supabase.js to load from environment variables
- Updated verify-supabase.js with dotenv support
- All verification scripts now use .env file

### Git Commit:

## Session 2026-02-03 (Afternoon): Debugging & Testing Marathon ✅

### Major Progress:

#### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite Created ✅
- Built App.test-suite.js with 6 progressive tests
- ALL TESTS PASSED via USB connection:
  - ✅ Test 1: Basic React Native components
  - ✅ Test 2: Theme & constants import
  - ✅ Test 3: Supabase connection
  - ✅ Test 4: Camera permissions
  - ✅ Test 5: Location services
  - ✅ Test 6: User context
- Proved all individual components work correctly

#### 2. Fixed Multiple Critical Issues ✅
**Issue 1: Network Download Error**
- **Solution:** Used USB connection instead of WiFi/tunnel
- Command: `npx expo start --localhost`
- Android phone connected via USB with USB Debugging enabled

**Issue 2: Node Modules Corruption**
- **Error:** `Got unexpected undefined: nullthrows.js`
- **Solution:** `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Added missing `ora` package

**Issue 3: Camera Component API Mismatch**
- **Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read property 'Type' of undefined`
- **Solution:** Updated to expo-camera v17 API:
  - Changed `Camera` → `CameraView`
  - Changed `Camera.Constants.Type.front` → `"front"` string
  - Updated to `useCameraPermissions()` hook
  - Changed `type` prop → `facing` prop

**Issue 4: Storage Upload Path Error**
- **Error:** "Failed to create profile - Storage unknown error"
- **Root cause:** Double-nested path `selfies/selfies/filename.jpg`
- **Solution:** Fixed uploadSelfie() to use filename directly (not `selfies/${filename}`)

#### 3. Current Status ✅
- ✅ App loads successfully via USB
- ✅ Camera screen appears and works
- ✅ Photo capture working

## Session 2026-02-03 (Afternoon Continued): BREAKTHROUGH - App Working! ✅

### Major Achievement: First Successful End-to-End Test! 🎉

#### 1. Fixed Storage Upload Issue ✅
**Problem:** "StorageUnknownError: Network request failed" during profile creation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `fetch()` on local `file://` URIs doesn't work in React Native
- expo-file-system deprecated API in SDK 54
- Office WiFi network blocking Supabase Storage

**Solutions Applied:**
1. ✅ Installed `expo-file-system` package
2. ✅ Updated to legacy FileSystem API for SDK 54 compatibility
3. ✅ Implemented XMLHttpRequest upload (more reliable than fetch in RN)
4. ✅ Switched phone to cellular data to bypass office network block

**Key Fix - database.js uploadSelfie():**
```javascript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';

// Read file as base64
const base64 = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(photoUri, {
  encoding: 'base64',
});

// Convert to binary and upload via XHR
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('POST', uploadUrl);
xhr.setRequestHeader('apikey', supabaseKey);
xhr.send(bytes.buffer);
```

#### 2. Network Discovery - Office WiFi Blocking ✅
**Critical Finding:** Office/corporate WiFi networks often block cloud storage services

**Workaround:**
- ✅ Phone switched to cellular data
- ✅ USB connection maintained for Metro bundler
- ✅ Profile creation succeeded immediately

**Important Note:** Always test on cellular or home WiFi, not corporate networks!

#### 3. Gallery Picker Fix ✅
**Issue:** Gallery selection showed confusing crop screen with no save button

**Fix:**
- Removed `allowsEditing: true` from ImagePicker
- Added proper media library permissions
- Simplified UX - direct photo selection without crop

#### 4. UI Fix - Nudge Button Positioning ✅
**Issue:** Nudge button cut off / too far right in user cards

**Fix:**
- Added `flex: 1` to userInfo container
- Added margin between user info and button
- Set minWidth on button for consistency

### What's Working Now (Verified) ✅

**Profile Creation:**
- ✅ Camera capture works
- ✅ Gallery selection works
- ✅ Photo upload to Supabase Storage succeeds
- ✅ User record created in database
- ✅ Dashboard loads with user data

**Dashboard Screen:**
- ✅ Profile photo displays correctly
- ✅ Name displays correctly
- ✅ Status toggle ON by default with green glow
- ✅ "Visible to others within 100m" message

**Proximity Detection:**
- ✅ Real user detected at 1m distance!
- ✅ User card displays photo, name, distance
- ✅ Nudge button visible and functional
- ✅ Real-time nearby users working

### Git Commits Today (Afternoon):
- `2491747` - Fix storage upload for React Native file URIs
- `b1aad85` - Use legacy expo-file-system API for SDK 54 compatibility
- `c6a2047` - Use XMLHttpRequest for more reliable uploads in React Native
- `8e2fcd6` - Fix gallery picker by removing confusing crop screen
- `d907673` - Fix nudge button positioning in user cards

### Files Modified:
- `src/lib/database.js` - Complete rewrite of uploadSelfie() function
- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - Gallery picker improvements
- `src/screens/DashboardScreen.js` - Button positioning fix
- `package.json` - Added expo-file-system

### Current Status - Ready for Full Testing ✅

**What Works:**
- ✅ Complete profile creation flow
- ✅ Photo uploads (on cellular/home WiFi)
- ✅ Dashboard with real data
- ✅ Proximity detection (verified with real user at 1m!)
- ✅ User cards display correctly
- ✅ Nudge button ready

**Ready to Test:**
- 🧪 Nudge system (send/receive)
- 🧪 Mutual match → Green Light screen
- 🧪 Haptic feedback
- 🧪 Status toggle (ON/OFF)
- 🧪 Location tracking
- 🧪 Pull to refresh
- 🧪 Sign out functionality

### Key Learnings:

1. **React Native File Uploads:** Must use FileSystem API, not fetch() on file:// URIs
2. **Expo SDK 54:** Use legacy FileSystem imports (`expo-file-system/legacy`)
3. **Corporate Networks:** Block cloud storage - always test on cellular/home WiFi
4. **XMLHttpRequest:** More reliable than fetch() for uploads in React Native
5. **USB + Cellular:** Best combo for development (USB for Metro, cellular for API)

### Testing Environment:
- **Desktop:** Mac on office WiFi (Metro bundler)
- **Phone:** Android via USB + cellular data (app runtime)
- **Supabase:** Fully configured and working
- **Real User Nearby:** 1m distance detected!

---

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03 14:29 (Profile creation working, proximity verified!)
**Resume From:** Test nudge system with nearby user at 1m distance

## 2026-02-18: Bug Fixes - SafeAreaView & Image Uploads

### Issues Fixed

1. **SafeAreaView Deprecation Warning**
   - **Problem:** Console warning: "SafeAreaView has been deprecated"
   - **Root Cause:** 13 screen files still importing SafeAreaView from 'react-native'
   - **Solution:** Migrated all files to 'react-native-safe-area-context'
   - **Files Updated:**
     - Setup1Screen, Setup2Screen, Setup3Screen
     - CameraScreen, WelcomeScreen
     - BirthdayScreen, BioScreen, LookingForScreen
     - HostOnboarding1, HostOnboarding2, HostOnboarding3
     - CreateEventScreen, EventSuccessScreen

2. **Chat Image Upload Failures**
   - **Problem:** Images failing to upload with "Bucket not found" error
   - **Root Causes:**
     - `chat-images` storage bucket didn't exist in Supabase
     - FormData approach unreliable in React Native for file:// URIs
   - **Solution:**
     - Created `chat-images` bucket with public access + RLS policies
     - Replaced FormData with XMLHttpRequest pattern (proven from selfie uploads)
     - Added expo-file-system/legacy for base64 reading
     - Binary encoding via Uint8Array (not base64 strings)
     - 60s timeout handling

### Key Implementation Changes

**messages.js (Image Upload Refactor):**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken - FormData)
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('', { uri, type, name });
await fetch(uploadUrl, { body: formData });

// AFTER (working - XMLHttpRequest)
const base64 = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(imageUri, { encoding: 'base64' });
const bytes = new Uint8Array(...); // Binary conversion
xhr.send(bytes.buffer);
```

**Storage Bucket Setup:**
- Bucket: `chat-images` (public, 5MB limit, image/* only)
- RLS Policies: INSERT, SELECT, DELETE for anon users
- Matches existing `selfies` bucket pattern

### Testing Recommendations

- Test SafeAreaView on iPhone X+ (notched devices) and Android
- Test image upload on cellular data (corporate WiFi may block)
- Verify location sharing opens Maps (not raw coordinates)
- Check that unmatch functionality works end-to-end

### Documentation Updated

- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Added completed features
- ✅ SUPABASE_SETUP.md - Added chat-images bucket setup
- ✅ SESSION_NOTES.md - This file
- ✅ Plan document - All checkboxes marked

---

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18 (SafeAreaView migration complete, image uploads working)
**Next:** Test image uploads end-to-end on real devices
